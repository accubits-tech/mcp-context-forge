Create a Python function that interacts with a REST API to fetch user data.

The function should:
- Accept a user ID as a parameter
- Make an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint
- Handle different HTTP status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.)
- Parse the JSON response
- Return structured user data
- Include proper error handling for network issues
- Log important events
- Use the requests library for HTTP calls
- Follow Python best practices and PEP 8 standards

API Endpoint: https://api.example.com/users/{user_id}
Expected Response Format: JSON with user information (id, name, email, etc.)

The function should be production-ready with comprehensive error handling and logging.
