## ðŸ§  Local Deployment of OpenWebUI + MCP Tools

This tutorial helps you set up **OpenWebUI** integrated with **Ollama**, **LiteLLM**, **MCPO**, and the **MCP Gateway** in a local containerized environment using Docker. It covers:

- Running LLMs locally via Ollama
- Using LiteLLM as a proxy for unified model access
- Bridging MCP tools through MCPO to OpenWebUI
- Managing MCP servers with the MCP Gateway
- Connecting it all through Docker networks

Perfect for experimenting on your workstation or air-gapped environments.
